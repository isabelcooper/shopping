It knows about the following items:

orange : 0.50
apple: 0.40
banana: 0.15


The supermarket are really struggling to sell oranges as one of their competitors has a special offer on. The

e.g.

shopping_cart(['orange', 'apple', 'banana']) => 1.05
shopping_cart(['orange', 'orange']) => 0.50
shopping_cart(['orange', 'orange', 'orange']) => 1.00
shopping_cart(['orange', 'orange', 'orange', 'orange']) => 1.00
