# Shopping Cart #

A large supermarket want you to build them a shopping cart application to install in their self checkouts. They're in
a massive hurry, so they're going to trial it with a limited set of items. The current hardware is all set up and they've
built most of the software in Ruby, but they haven't figured out the receipt system yet.

Step 1 

Your shopping cart application show be able to accept a list of items and should return the total cost of all the items.

The items you can buy are the following (prices included):

orange : 0.50
apple: 0.40
banana: 0.15

e.g.

shopping_cart(['orange', 'apple', 'banana']) => 1.05
shopping_cart(['orange', 'orange', 'orange']) => 1.50
